## Introduction


The aim of the project was to find a replacement for Jude Bellingham in the Borussia Dortmund team.
The machine learning model was made using the k-means algorithm in Python.


## Project Description


For the project, I used data from the FbRef website for the 2022/2023 season. I performed web scraping to download the data from the site, and then I modelled it appropriately. In the next step, I decided to use the k-means algorithm and the percentage similarity of players in the cluster I was interested in to select the players. From the 20 most similar players to Jude Bellingham, I selected 5 players for further analysis:
Maxence Caqueret Enzo Le Fée Lazar Samardzic Tijjani Reijnders Kenneth Taylor
I made the selection based on their market value, age and the quality of the team they play for. I also compared the players that Borussia bought in the summer transfer window of 2023 to replace Jude Bellingham, which are Felix Nmecha and Marcel Sabitzer.


## Further Analysis


For further analysis, I decided to use pie charts based on the pie charts from the StatsBomb website. The following statistics were used to create the pie charts:
- Per 90 Minutes xAG – expected assists per 90 minutes
- Per 90 Minutes npxG – expected non-penalty goals per 90 minutes
- PrgC/90 – progressive carries per 90 minutes
-	PrgP/90 – progressive passes per 90 minutes
-	ProR/90 – progressive receptions per 90 minutes
-	Total Cmp % - pass completion percentage
-	KP/90 – key passes per 90 minutes
-	SCA/90 - shot-creating actions per 90 minutes
-	GCA/90 – goal-creating actions per 90 minutes
-	Tac/90 – tackles per 90 minutes
-	TklW % - tackle win percentage
-	Int/90 – interceptions per 90 minutes


## Conclusion


Based on the pie charts, I believe that Borussia could have found a better replacement for Jude Bellingham. The previous data is from the previous season, in which Marcel Sabitzer did not perform well for various reasons (injury, not used by the coach).

The acquisition of this player seems justified to me, because he is an experienced player who has shown that he can play at the highest level both in Europe and in the national league. In his case, focusing only on the data from the previous season could be harmful. However, in the case of Felix Nmecha, I think Borussia should decide on another player. Based on the pie charts, we can see that practically every player had more similar individual statistics to Jude Bellingham than Nmecha. In addition, he cost Borussia 30 million euros.

Focusing only on the players who changed clubs in the summer transfer window, namely Enzo Le Fée, Lazar Samardzic (he was close to moving to Inter Milan for 20 million euros, but his transfer failed) and Tijjani Reijnders, none of them cost more than 20 million euros (Enzo Le Fee cost the most, exactly 20 million euros according to Transfermarkt). Buying one of these players, who performed better in the previous season than Felix Nmecha, would have saved Borussia 10 million euros, which they could have used to strengthen other positions or simply save money for other expenses.

Whether the conclusions of my project will prove to be true? As a fan of Borussia Dortmund, I hope that Felix Nmecha will surprise me positively in the upcoming season.
